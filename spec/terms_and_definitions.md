New blocks are replicated across copies of the ledger within the network, and any conflicts are resolved automatically using established rules.

~ Source: [NIST-CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/blockchain)

~ Supporting definitions:

~ [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) A [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) with growing lists of [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_\(computer_science\)) (blocks) that are securely linked together via [cryptographic hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping), and transaction data (generally represented as a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), where [data nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_\(computer_science\)) are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

[[def: broadcast]]:
~ In computer networking, telecommunication and information theory, broadcasting is a method of transferring a [[ref: message]] to all recipients simultaneously. Broadcast delivers a message to all [[ref: nodes]] in the network using a one-to-all association; a single [[ref: datagram]] (or [[ref: packet]]) from one sender is routed to all of the possibly multiple endpoints associated with the [[ref: broadcast address]]. The network automatically replicates [[ref: datagrams]] as needed to reach all the recipients within the scope of the broadcast, which is generally an entire network subnet.

[[def: broadcast address]]:
~ A broadcast address is a [[ref: network address]] used to transmit to all devices connected to a multiple-access [[ref: communications]] network. A [[ref: message]] sent to a broadcast address may be received by all network-attached [[ref: hosts]]. In contrast, a [[ref: multicast address]] is used to address a specific group of devices, and a [[ref: unicast address]] is used to address a single device. For network layer communications, a broadcast address may be a specific [[ref: IP address]].

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority): In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that stores, signs, and issues [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate). A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority#cite_note-1) The format of these certificates is specified by the [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) or [EMV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV) standard.

[[def: claim]]:
~ An assertion about a [[ref: subject]], typically expressed as an [[ref: attribute]] or [[ref: property]] of the [[ref: subject]]. It is called a “claim” because the assertion is always made by some [[ref: party]], called the [[ref: issuer]] of the claim, and the [[ref: validity]] of the claim must be judged by the [[ref: verifier]]. 

~ Supporting definitions:

~ [W3C VC](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology): An assertion made about a [subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-subjects).

[[def: communication session]]:
~ A finite period for which a [[ref: communication channel]] is instantiated and maintained, during which certain [[ref: properties]] of that channel, such as authentication of the participants, are in effect. A session has a beginning, called the session initiation, and an ending, called the session termination.

~ Supporting definitions:

~ [NIST-CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/session): A persistent interaction between a subscriber and an end point, either a relying party or a Credential Service Provider. A session begins with an authentication event and ends with a session termination event. A session is bound by use of a session secret that the subscriber’s software (a browser, application, or operating system) can present to the relying party or the Credential Service Provider in lieu of the subscriber’s authentication credentials.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_\(computer_science\)): In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) in particular, a session is a time-delimited two-way link, a practical (relatively high) layer in the [TCP/IP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) enabling interactive expression and information exchange between two or more communication devices or ends – be they computers, [automated systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation), or live active users (see [login session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login_session)). A session is established at a certain point in time, and then ‘torn down’ - brought to an end - at some later point. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is typically [stateful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful), meaning that at least one of the communicating parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the session history to be able to communicate, as opposed to [stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_server) communication, where the communication consists of independent [requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request-response) with responses. An established session is the basic requirement to perform a [connection-oriented communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication). A session also is the basic step to transmit in [connectionless communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication) modes. However, any unidirectional transmission does not define a session.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption): End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a private communication system in which only communicating users can participate. As such, no one, including the communication system provider, [telecom providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_service_providers), [Internet providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_providers) or malicious actors, can access the [cryptographic keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_\(cryptography\)) needed to converse. End-to-end [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) is intended to prevent data being read or secretly modified, other than by the true sender and recipient(s). The messages are encrypted by the sender but the third party does not have a means to decrypt them, and stores them encrypted. The recipients retrieve the encrypted data and decrypt it themselves.


[[def: End-to-End Principle]]:
~ The end-to-end principle is a design framework in computer networking. In networks designed according to this principle, guaranteeing certain application-specific features, such as reliability and security, requires that they reside in the communicating end [[ref: nodes]] of the network. [[ref: Intermediary]] nodes, such as [[ref: gateways]] and [[ref: routers]], that exist to establish the network, may implement these to improve efficiency but cannot guarantee end-to-end correctness.

[[def: trust]]:
~ A belief that an [[ref: entity]] will behave in a predictable manner in specified circumstances. The entity may be a person, process, object or any combination of such components. The entity can be of any size from a single hardware component or software module, to a piece of equipment identified by make and model, to a site or location, to an organization, to a nation-state. Trust, while inherently a subjective determination, can be based on objective evidence and subjective elements. The objective grounds for trust can include for example, the results of information technology product testing and evaluation. Subjective belief, level of comfort, and experience may supplement (or even replace) objective evidence, or substitute for such evidence when it is unavailable. Trust is usually relative to a specific circumstance or situation (e.g., the amount of money involved in a transaction, the sensitivity or criticality of information, or whether safety is an issue with human lives at stake). Trust is generally not transitive (e.g., you trust a friend but not necessarily a friend of a friend). Finally, trust is generally earned, based on experience or measurement.

[[def: trusted execution environment]]:
~ A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure area of a main processor. It helps code and data loaded inside it to be protected with respect to [[ref: confidentiality]] and [[ref: integrity]]. Data [[ref: integrity]] prevents [[ref: unauthorized]] [[ref: entities]] from outside the TEE from altering [[ref: data]], while code integrity prevents code in the TEE from being replaced or modified by [[ref: unauthorized]] [[ref: entities]], which may also be the computer [[ref: owner]] itself as in certain [[ref: DRM]] schemes.

[[def: trusted role]]:
~ A [role](http://role) that performs restricted activities for an [[ref: organization]] after meeting competence, security and background [[ref: verification]] [[ref: requirements]] for that [[ref: role]].


[[def: trusted third party]]:
~ In [[ref: cryptography]], a trusted [[ref: third party]] (TTP) is an entity which facilitates interactions between two [[ref: parties]] who both trust the third party; the third party reviews all critical transaction communications between the parties, based on the ease of creating fraudulent digital content. In TTP models, the [[ref: relying parties]] use this trust to secure their own interactions. TTPs are common in any number of commercial transactions and in cryptographic digital transactions as well as cryptographic protocols, for example, a [[ref: certificate authority]] (CA) would issue a [[ref: digital certificate]] to one of the two parties in the next example. The CA then becomes the TTP to that certificate's issuance. Likewise transactions that need a third party recordation would also need a third-party repository service of some kind.

[[def: trustworthiness]]:
~ An [[ref: attribute]] of a [[ref: person]] or [[ref: organization]] that provides confidence to others of the qualifications, capabilities, and reliability of that [[ref: entity]] to perform specific tasks and fulfill assigned responsibilities. Trustworthiness is also a characteristic of information technology products and systems. The attribute of trustworthiness, whether applied to people, processes, or technologies, can be measured, at least in relative terms if not quantitatively. The determination of trustworthiness plays a key role in establishing [[ref: trust relationships]] among [[ref: persons]] and [[ref: organizations]]. The [[ref: trust relationships]] are key factors in [[ref: risk decisions]] made by senior leaders/executives.

[[def: zero-knowledge service]]:
~ In cloud computing, the term “zero-knowledge” refers to an online service that stores, transfers or manipulates [[ref: data]] in a way that maintains a high level of [[ref: confidentiality]], where the data is only accessible to the [[ref: data's]] [[ref: owner]] (the client), and not to the service provider. This is achieved by [[ref: encrypting]] the raw data at the client's side or [[ref: end-to-end]] (in case there is more than one client), without disclosing the password to the service provider. This means that neither the service provider, nor any [[ref: third party]] that might intercept the [[ref: data]], can [[ref: decrypt]] and access the [[ref: data]] without prior permission, allowing the client a higher degree of privacy than would otherwise be possible. In addition, zero-knowledge services often strive to hold as little [[ref: metadata]] as possible, holding only that [[ref: data]] that is functionally needed by the service.

~ [NIST-CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/zero_trust_architecture): A security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries. The zero trust security model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, component, node, or service and instead requires continuous verification of the operational picture via real-time information from multiple sources to determine access and other system responses.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model): The zero trust security model, also known as zero trust architecture (ZTA), and sometimes known as perimeterless security, describes an approach to the strategy, design and implementation of [IT systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_system). The main concept behind the zero trust security model is "never trust, always verify," which means that users and devices should not be trusted by default, even if they are connected to a permissioned network such as a corporate [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) and even if they were previously verified.
