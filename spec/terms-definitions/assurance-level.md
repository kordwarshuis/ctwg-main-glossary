[[def: assurance-level, assurance level, assurance levels]]

~ A level of confidence in a [[ref: claim]] that may be relied on by others. Different types of assurance levels are defined for different types of trust assurance mechanisms. Examples include [[ref: authenticator assurance level]], [[ref: federation assurance level]], and [[ref: identity assurance level]].

~ For verifiable credentials, the Level of Assurance measures the degree of certainty in an identity's authenticity or a credential's validity, ensuring the credential is from a trusted source and has not been tampered with. The level is determined by the strength of the identity assurance process, the robustness of the authentication process, and the management of the credential issuer.
